# TUAB Dataset

This is a curated version of the [TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus (TUAB)](https://isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/html/downloads.shtml) v3.0.1.



- The original file names (e.g. "aaaaamye_s001_t000.edf") with subject identifier, session, and token number, are mapped to subject, session, and run BIDS entities.
- Age and sex information are extracted from the edf headers and added to the participants.tsv file.
- The official split (train, eval) is specified in the participants.tsv file.
- The "normal" vs "abnormal" annotations are specified in the scants.tsv files. The reason for this is that TUAB contains a few subjects with both "normal" and "abnormal" recordings â€“ hence this information cannot be specified on the subject level in participants.tsv.
- Channel names and types are harmonised.



## Reproduce from the Source Data

1. [Request access](https://isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/html/downloads.shtml) and download TUAB to `sourcedata/`

   ```
   mkdir sourcedata
   rsync -auxvL nedc-eeg@www.isip.piconepress.com:data/eeg/tuh_eeg_abnormal/v3.0.1/ sourcedata/v3.0.1
   ```

2. Install dependencies or use an existing environment with mne and mne-bids installed.
   Example using mamba:

   ```
   mamba create -n bidsify python=3.10 mne mne-bids
   mamba activate bidsify
   ```

3. Run the BIDS conversion script.

   ```
   python code/convert_TUAB_to_BIDS.py
   ```
